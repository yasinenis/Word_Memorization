  # Word Memorization app 
  
  ### Developed to memorizing words and sentences from any language make useful for everyone. 
  
  Totally Created with chatGPT before learning how to coding and before starting my college :)

I just started to study Computeer Engineering at Recep Tayyip Erdogan University and I'm watching anime, films or anything with english subtitles to improve my english so when I saw a word I dont know mean of it, I'm adding favorites in google translate page. Then I download this favorite words as an exel document (google translate has an option for that). When I open my word memorization app, I choose this exel document and this app randomly asks the turkish meanings of english words from exel document from which document I chose. If you would you could choose another exel document which you would learn words inside of it.

This app asking you, which words you have to learn. Thats why good idea to develop and use this sweet application for improve self language knowledge.
