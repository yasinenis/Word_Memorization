  Word_Memorization app developed by Yasin Eniş to memorize english words and sentences useful.

  Im just started to study computeer engineering at Recep Tayyip Erdogan University and I'm watching anime, films or anything with english subtitles to improve my english and when I saw a word I dont know mean of it, I'm adding favorites in google translate site. After that I download this favorute words as an exel document (google translate has an option about that). When I open my word memorization app ı choose this exel document and this app randomly asking the turkish meanings of english words from exel document which I chose. If you want you can choose another exel document which you want to learn words inside of it.

  This app asking which words you have to learn. Thats why good idea to develop and use this sweet application.
